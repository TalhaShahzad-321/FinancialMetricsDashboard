Some Imp Stand For
*EBITDA stands for Earnings Before Interest, Taxes, Depreciation, and Amortization 
#FORMULA
EBITDA=Net Income+Interest+Taxes+Depreciation+Amortization

*PBT stands for Profit Before Tax. 
#FORMULA
PBT=Revenue−Expenses

*COGS stands for Cost of Goods Sold.
#FORMULA
COGS=Beginning Inventory+Purchases During the Period−Ending Inventory
E.G
Beginning Inventory: $10,000
Purchases During the Period: $50,000
Ending Inventory: $8,000
The COGS would be calculated as:

COGS=Beginning Inventory+Purchases During the Period−Ending Inventory
COGS=10,000+50,000−8,000
COGS=52,000


*Gross profit is the money a company makes from selling its products after subtracting the costs directly involved in making those
 products
#FORMULA
Gross Profit=Revenue−Cost of Goods Sold (COGS)
Example
Let's say you own a bakery. In one month:

You make $10,000 from selling cakes and pastries (this is your revenue).
The cost of ingredients, packaging, and labor to make those cakes and pastries is $4,000 (this is your COGS).
Gross Profit=$10,000−$4,000=$6,000


DAX QUERY
1:To calculate gross profit,First create new column and write this dax on new column
*Gross Profit = Actual[Net Revenue]) - Actual[COGS]
#Now create New Measure
*Gross Profit1 = SUM(Actual[Goss Profit])

2:To calculate Net Revenue,First create new column and write this dax on new column
*Net Revenue = Actual[Gross Sales] - Actual[Total T & Disc]
#Now create New Measure
*Net Revenue = SUM(Actual[Net Revenue])

3:To calculate ETIDA(earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation, and amortizatio),First create new column and write this Dax
*EBITDA1 = 
Actual[Goss Profit] - 
Actual[Marketing] - 
Actual[S&D] - 
Actual[G&A] - 
Actual[Other Inc & Exp] + 
Actual[Depriciation] + 
Actual[One Off Item]

#Now create New Measure
*EBITDA = SUM(Actual[Ebitda])

3:To calculate PAT(profit after tax),First create new column and write this Dax For Net Profit
*Net Profit= 
'Actual'[Net Revenue] 
- 'Actual'[Raw Material] 
- 'Actual'[Packging Material] 
- 'Actual'[Total Fixed & Variable Cost] 
- 'Actual'[Marketing] 
- 'Actual'[S&D] 
- 'Actual'[G&A] 
- 'Actual'[Other Inc & Exp] 
- 'Actual'[Depriciation] 
- 'Actual'[One Off Item] 
- 'Actual'[Tax] 
+ 'Actual'[Interest Income] 
- 'Actual'[Interest Exp]

#Now create New Measure
#2 formula are there if we have subtract tax from net profit while calculating net profit then use this dax
*Pat1 = SUM(Actual[Net Profit])
#Other wise use this dax
*PAT = SUM(Actual[Net Profit]) - SUM(Actual[Tax]):

4:To Calculate total volume
*Total Volume MT = SUM(Actual[Volume Mt])

5:To calculate Operating Expense
*Operating Expenses = 
SUM('Actual'[Raw Material]) + 
SUM('Actual'[Packging Material]) + 
SUM('Actual'[Total Fixed & Variable Cost]) + 
SUM('Actual'[Marketing]) + 
SUM('Actual'[S&D]) + 
SUM('Actual'[G&A])


6:To calculate Non Operating Expense
*Non-Operating Expenses = SUM('Actual'[Interest Exp])

7:To calculate Operating Income
*Operating Income = 
SUM('Actual'[Net Revenue])

8:To calculate Non Operating Income
*Non-Operating Income = SUM('Actual'[Interest Income])

9:To Calculate Year To Date Net Revenue
*YTD Net Revenue = 
TOTALYTD(
    [Net Revenue], 
    'Dim Date'[Month End Date],
    ALL('Dim Date')
)
#EXPLANATION'
SUM('Actual'[Net Revenue]):   Aggregates the Net Revenue.
TOTALYTD:                     Computes the year-to-date value.
'Dim Date'[Month End Date]:   The column representing dates.
ALL('Dim Date'):              Ensures the function considers all date
Year To Date value is sum of net revenue
E.G
Date	Net Revenue
2024-01-31	1000
2024-02-28	1500
2024-03-31	1200
...	...
2024-07-31	2000
If today’s date is July 31, 2024, the YTD Net Revenue would be the sum of Net Revenue from January 1, 2024, to July 31, 2024.

10:To calculate year to year change % in Net Revenue 
#First We Have To Calculate Previous Year Revenue
*Previous_Year_Revenue = CALCULATE([Net Revenue],SAMEPERIODLASTYEAR('Dim Date'[Month End Date].[Date]))
#Now Calculate Year To Year Change
*YOY_Percetage_Change_In_Revenue = DIVIDE([Net Revenue]-[Previous_Year_Revenue],[Previous_Year_Revenue])


11:Write dax to calculate year to date(month to month) Change In Revenue
First Calculate previous year Net Revenue
*Previous_Year_YTD_Revenue = CALCULATE([YTD Net Revenue],SAMEPERIODLASTYEAR('Dim Date'[Month End Date].[Date]))
Now calculate year to date(month to month) change Percentage
*YOY_Percetage_Change_In_YTD_NetRevenue = DIVIDE([YTD Net Revenue]-[Previous_Year_YTD_Revenue],[Previous_Year_YTD_Revenue])

#
#

IMP POINT
*Difference Between previous Year Revenue And Previous Year Revenue ytd
#For Previous_Year_Revenue:
If the current context is March 2021, this measure will return the revenue for March 2020.

#For Previous_Year_YTD_Revenue:
If the current context is March 2021, this measure will return the cumulative revenue from January 2020 to March 2020.

12:Calculate to find percentage of gross profit
*Gross_Profit% = [Gross Profit]/[Net Revenue]

13:Calculate to find percentage of EBITDA
*EBITDA% = [EBITDA]/[Net Revenue]

14:Calculate to find percentage of PAT
*PAT% = [Pat]/[Net Revenue]

15:Calculate Total Raw Material cost
*Raw_Material_Cost = SUM(Actual[Raw Material])*-1
#we have multiply it with -1 Because We Want our cost In Positive

16:Calculate Total Fixed And Variable Cost
*Total Fixed And Variable cost = SUM(Actual[Total Fixed & Variable Cost])*-1
#we have multiply it with -1 Because We Want our cost In Positive

17:Calculate Total Sale And Distribution Cost
*Total s&d Cost = CALCULATE(SUM(Actual[S&D])*-1)
#we have multiply it with -1 Because We Want our cost In Positive


18:Calculate General And Administrative Cost
*General And Administrative Cost = CALCULATE(SUM(Actual[G&A])*-1)
#we have multiply it with -1 Because We Want our cost In Positive

19:Raw material cost percetage and use on line and stack column chart
*Raw_Material_% = [Raw_Material_Cost]/[Net Revenue]


20:3 page pur sku ka percentage bataya gya hai ka wo kitna contribute karha hai aur kitna percentage revenue contribute karha hai.

21:4 Page Pur how many difference is between net revenue for actual and net revenue for budget. What is percentage change between them?
#First calulate whole value difference then percentage change
*Net_Revenue_Difference = [Net Revenue]-[Net_Revenue_Budget]
#Now calculate percentage change
*Net_Revenue_Percentage_Change = 
DIVIDE(
    [Net_Revenue_Difference], 
    [Net_Revenue_Budget], 
    0
)

#OPTIMIZATION OF BUSINESS
Q1:Height of bar show sku and width of bar show revenue using mekko chart
Use tree map instead of meeko chart because not availale on my BI


Q2:Pareto Analysis:
Jis business mei volume kum hoo aur value zyada hoo E.G gold business mei volume kum sale hoo tub bhi value zyada milti hai 
Question: 4208 sku mei sa konsa 20% sku hai jo contribute karha hai 80 % revenue, konsa 80% sku hai jo 20% revenue mei contribute karha hai.
First We Have To Find Top SKU
